		I wanted a project to try out SvelteKit and I also
		wanted to be able to randomly shuffle and save a
		playlist to YouTube Music, so, I made this!
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Usage:</strong> Click playlist, click shuffle button, click save button.
		You can also click playlist headers to sort.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Data Collection Policy:</strong> We do not collect
		any data. All storage is done via the browser's localStoage.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I make absolutely no guarantees of how well this
		will work for you. Use at your own risk.
